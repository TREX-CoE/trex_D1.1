  abstract =     {We present a new computing environment for authoring
                  mixed natural and computer language documents. In
                  this environment a single hierarchically-organized
                  plain text source file may contain a variety of
                  elements such as code in arbitrary programming
                  languages, raw data, links to external resources,
                  project management data, working notes, and text for
                  publication. Code fragments may be executed in situ
                  with graphical, numerical and textual output
                  captured or linked in the file. Export to LATEX,
                  HTML, LATEX beamer, DocBook and other formats
                  permits working reports, presentations and
                  manuscripts for publication to be generated from the
                  file. In addition, functioning pure code files can
                  be automatically extracted from the file. This
                  environment is implemented as an extension to the
                  Emacs text editor and provides a rich set of
                  features for authoring both prose and code, as well
                  as sophisticated project management capabilities.},
